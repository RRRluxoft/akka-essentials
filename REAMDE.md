**(for the repository of the Akka Classic course, click [here](https://github.com/rockthejvm/akka-classic-essentials))**

Powered by [Rock the JVM!](rockthejvm.com)

This repository contains the code we wrote during [Rock the JVM's Akka Typed Essentials](https://rockthejvm.com/p/akka-essentials) course. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

### How to start

Clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag:

```
git checkout start
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the lectures. Prior to each lecture, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `start`
* `1.1-scala-recap`
* `1.2-multithreading`
* `2.2-actors`
* `2.3-actors-exercises`
* `2.5-actor-state`
* `2.6-child-actors`
* `2.7-child-actors-exercise`
* `2.8-stopping-actors`
* `2.9-watching-actors`
* `2.10-breaking-encapsulation`
* `2.11-supervision`
* `3.1-testing-basics`
* `3.2-test-probes`
* `3.3-timed-assertions`
* `3.4-intercepting-logs`
* `3.5-synchronous-testing`
* `4.1-config`
* `4.2-schedulers`
* `4.3-timers`
* `4.4-routers`
* `4.5-dispatchers`
* `4.6-mailboxes`
* `5.1-ask`
* `5.2-pipe`
* `5.3-stash`

When you watch a lecture, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.
